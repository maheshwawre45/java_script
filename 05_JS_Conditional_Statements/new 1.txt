instead of creating individual variable we can group all the individual
into bo=igger variable into object .
An ovject is a variable which contains similar kind of data with respective to its properties .
we will object in js as follows:

var emp = {};

we can add properties to an object is as follows :
emp.name = 'john';
emp.age =40;
emp.sal=40000;

in the abobe example we have created empty object and properties to empty objectj

we can create object with all the properties as follows 

var student={
name = 'john',
age = 30,
sal = 40000

} 

we can access the value of an object ads follows .


console.log(student.name);

we can accwss properties of an object using brac notation asd follows .

console.log(student['name']);

if you are trying to access property wich not exist in the object then we get the value undefined.

each object may conden some other objectd as well thid inside object called as nested object.
